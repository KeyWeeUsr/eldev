name: Feature request
about: Suggest new Eldev features or improvements to existing features
---

You can describe the proposed feature in free form and are not required to follow any template.

However, here are some question, at least some of which you should answer in the created issue:

* What is the exact problem you are trying to solve, automate etc.?

* How would you like to do that with Eldev, i.e. how would the proposed feature work?

* Are there workarounds or alternatives using which you can achieve this result (probably in more steps, or less conveniently, or using external tools)?

* Are there parallels in other development tools, especially those targeted at Elisp too?

Also, please keep in mind that I'm not necessarily familiar with what you are doing, problems you face or experience you have. In particular, it might be helpful to give a link to your project, if available online, especially if the proposal requires some non-trivial setup.
