== Requirements

Eldev runs on Emacs 24.4 and up.  On earlier Emacs versions it will be
overly verbose, but this is rather an Emacs problem.

Any “typical” OS — Linux, macOS, Windows or any POSIX-like system not
listed earlier — will do.  Additionally, since there is only a small
shell script (`.bat` file for Windows) that is really OS-dependent,
porting to other systems should not be difficult, volunteers welcome.

Eldev intentionally has no dependencies, at least currently: otherwise
your project would also see them, which could in theory lead to some
problems.
